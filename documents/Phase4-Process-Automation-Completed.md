### 1. Validation Rules Implemented

**Purpose:** Ensure data integrity and enforce business rules across all AgriConnect objects to maintain accurate farmer and crop data.

#### A) Farm Data Validation (Farm__c)

**Farm_Size_Positive**
- **Object:** Farm__c
- **Rule Name:** Farm_Size_Positive
- **Error Formula:** `Farm_Size__c <= 0`
- **Error Message:** "Farm size must be greater than 0 acres"
- **Business Logic:** Prevents farmers from entering invalid farm sizes
- **Screenshot Navigation:** Setup → Object Manager → Farm → Validation Rules → New
*Take screenshot showing validation rule configuration*



#### B) Crop Cycle Data Validation (Crop_Cycle__c)

**Harvest_After_Planting**
- **Object:** Crop_Cycle__c
- **Rule Name:** Harvest_After_Planting
- **Error Formula:** `AND(NOT(ISBLANK(Expected_Harvest_Date__c)), Expected_Harvest_Date__c <= Planting_Date__c)`
- **Error Message:** "Expected harvest date must be after planting date"
- **Business Logic:** Prevents illogical crop cycle timelines

**Area_Cannot_Exceed_Farm_Size**
- **Rule Name:** Area_Cannot_Exceed_Farm_Size
- **Error Formula:** `Area_Planted__c > Farm__r.Farm_Size__c`
- **Error Message:** "Planted area cannot exceed total farm size"
- **Business Logic:** Ensures realistic crop planning within farm boundaries

**Season_Date_Alignment**
- **Rule Name:** Season_Date_Alignment
- **Error Formula:** `AND(Season__c = "Kharif", OR(MONTH(Planting_Date__c) < 6, MONTH(Planting_Date__c) > 9))`
- **Error Message:** "Kharif crops must be planted between June-September"
- **Business Logic:** Aligns crop cycles with Indian agricultural seasons

#### C) MSP Price Validation (MSP_Price__c)

**MSP_Rate_Positive**
- **Object:** MSP_Price__c
- **Rule Name:** MSP_Rate_Positive
- **Error Formula:** `MSP_Rate__c <= 0`
- **Error Message:** "MSP rate must be greater than 0"
- **Business Logic:** Ensures valid government pricing data

**Future_Effective_Date**
- **Rule Name:** Future_Effective_Date
- **Error Formula:** `Effective_Date__c < TODAY()`
- **Error Message:** "MSP effective date cannot be in the past"
- **Business Logic:** Prevents outdated price entries
