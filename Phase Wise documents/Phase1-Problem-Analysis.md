---

### **1. PROBLEM STATEMENT**

#### **1.1 Core Business Problem**

Indian agriculture faces critical challenges that hinder farmer productivity, profitability, and sustainability:

**Primary Issues:**
- **Fragmented Information Systems:** Farmers lack centralized access to crop guidance, market prices, weather updates, and government schemes
- **Manual Documentation:** Paper-based record keeping leads to data loss, inefficient tracking of crop cycles, and difficulty accessing financial services
- **Limited Market Intelligence:** Farmers sell crops at suboptimal prices due to lack of real-time market information and direct buyer connections
- **Delayed Disease Detection:** Crop diseases and pest infestations are identified late, causing significant yield losses
- **Resource Mismanagement:** Inefficient use of seeds, fertilizers, and water due to lack of data-driven planning tools

#### **1.2 Target User Problems**

**Small and Marginal Farmers (Primary Users):**
- Difficulty tracking multiple crop cycles across different land parcels
- No digital record of farming activities for loan applications or insurance claims
- Limited access to agricultural extension services and expert advice
- Inability to plan optimal planting schedules based on weather and market conditions

**Agricultural Extension Officers (Secondary Users):**
- Manual data collection from farmers is time-consuming and error-prone
- Lack of centralized dashboard to monitor farmer progress across territories
- Difficulty in disseminating timely agricultural advisories to large farmer groups
- No systematic way to track the effectiveness of extension programs

**Agricultural Input Suppliers (Service Providers):**
- Limited visibility into farmer demand patterns for seeds, fertilizers, and equipment
- No direct connection platform to reach potential customers efficiently
- Difficulty in providing post-sale support and technical guidance

#### **1.3 Quantified Business Impact**

**Current State Statistics:**
- **70% of Indian farmers** are small/marginal with less than 2 hectares of land
- **Average crop loss of 15-20%** annually due to diseases, pests, and poor planning
- **30-40% price volatility** in agricultural markets affects farmer income
- **Only 25% of farmers** have access to formal credit due to lack of proper documentation
- **60% of agricultural extension positions** remain vacant, limiting farmer support

**Problem Severity:**
- Annual agricultural losses exceed **₹50,000 crores** due to inefficient practices
- Farmer distress leads to **rural-urban migration** and food security concerns
- Climate change increases uncertainty, requiring data-driven adaptation strategies
